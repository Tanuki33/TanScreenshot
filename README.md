# TanScreenshot
usualy i just use `Win+PrtSc` shortcut to take screenshot, but now i have 75% keyboard layout, pressing the `FN+WIN` will trigger the windows lock (bcs i need to press `FN+P` for the PrtSc key), so `FN+Win+PrtSc` is not possible. yeah there already a bunch screenshot software ready to use, but many of them are to much feature that i am not use, like crop image, add text, add shapes,etc. i will use paint or photopea instead if i want edit the screenshot anyway. i just need a software that can take screenshot like `Win+PrtSc` (take screenshot and automaticly save the image file.), so here i am, creating another screenshot for my self.

# Feature
- Easy to read config.json file
- Autorun at windows startup
- Copy to clipboard feature for those not using `PrtSc` key.
- Hotkey settings
